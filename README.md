## Contribution
### 1. Model Architecture
We propose VerbalTS, which consists of two key components: a multi-view noise estimator and a multi-focal text processor.

<p>
Our model considers the time series generation process from three perspectives: temporal view, spatial view, and diffusion view. The textual description is processed through multi-focal reprogramming, which integrates the relevant tokens through learnable anchor vectors. Finally, a condition adapter is applied to align the multi-semantic information from the text across the three views with the corresponding components of the time series. With the method above, we achieve fine-grained time series generation from the textual descriptions. 

### 2. Experimental Results
We compare our method, VerbalTS, with the baselines on two synthetic datasets Synth-M, Synth-U, two real-world datasets Weather, BlindWays, and two real-world augmented datasets ETTm1, Traffic. As shown in the table below, our method significantly improves the fidelity and semantic alignment of the generated time series.

### 3. Demo
Our method supports using verbal language to generate or edit the time series.
